# Mail-Bomb
A simple program to automate sending a large number of emails to a specified target. Refer to the read me file for more into :)




Hello there! 

In this program I am going to automate sending multiple emails with attatchments to your friends for fun 
please note that this program is intended only for Educational purposes so please use it at your own risk

Now before you actually use this program make sure of the following :

1. The first line of the user.txt file must have the mail address of the gmail you are sending your emails through and the second line must have the password.  
2. Any attachments that you would like to have in the mail should also be put in the same folder as the python file and the user.txt file.
3. Make sure to turn on "Less secure app access" for the account that you will be using, the link to it is "https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps"

To use this program just run the "run.bat" file.

Have Fun!
